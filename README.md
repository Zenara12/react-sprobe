# React 18 Setup Guide for an Existing Project

## Prerequisites
Before updating or running a React 18 project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version
- **NPM** or **Yarn**

## Cloning and Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zenara12/react-sprobe.git
cd your-project-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
Or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
```sh
npm run dev
```
Or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn dev
```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```sh
npm run build
```
Or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `build/` directory.


## Deployment
Your React app can be deployed using:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages

To deploy using GitHub Pages:
1. Install `gh-pages`:
   ```sh
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```
2. Deploy:
   ```sh
   npx gh-pages -d dist `or ./dist`
   ```
